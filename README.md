# Vue.js + Firebase + Tailwind CSS

## Motivation
I wanted to create a Todo List with Vue, Firebase and Tailwind to 
practice my skills and increase my repertoire.
I chose Vue and Firebase because they are quick and simple to work with.
The project started without Tailwind, but at the moment I saw it,
I knew i had to work with it.

## Todo List
In the beginning, you can see the hero section in the home page.
To access the Todos page, you need first to register an account or login.
After registering, you will be redirected to the Todos page.

## Todos page
The todos page have an input, where you can type your todo and a button to submit it.
Below it, your todos will be displayed. The user are able to toggle the todo completion
and delete it.
