# Vue + Firebase + Tailwind CSS

## Motivation
I wanted to create a Todo List with Vue and Firebase, so in the future, 
I would be able to build serverless web applications.
I've chosen Vue and Firebase because it is fast and simple to work with.

## Todo List
In the beginning, you can see the hero section in the home page (under construction).
To access the Todos page, you need first to register an account or login.
After registering, you will be redirected to the Todos page.

## Todos page
The todos page have an input, where you can type your todo and a button to submit it.
Below it, your todos will be displayed. The user are able to toggle the todo completion
and delete it.

### Todo
At this very moment, you are able to see everyone's todos.
This will change with Firebase Auth.
